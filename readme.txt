Anti-spam plugin - An advanced and free WP spam filter which protects your blog from 100 % of comment spam.

SpamTask is currently being updated, and we are working on a much more powerful anti-spam plugin (SpamTask version 2.0). Until we are finished, we advise using one of the other great spam filters you can find in the WordPress library.
